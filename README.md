# Library
This project is meant to practice prototyping and using JavaScript Objects to mimic a library. Books and their information will be stored as objects in an array.

Originally I was going to use ECMA5 standard vanilla objects, but I couldn't resist using classes instead. I believe classes make the code a little cleaner as most other languages use standard classes, regardless of the syntactic sugar, so I switched gears towards using classes.

Later the data will be saved using either firebase, or localStorage to be used as a app to keep track of whether you've read a book.
